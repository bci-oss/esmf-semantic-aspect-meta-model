<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="why-not-use-x-to-specify-aspect-models"><a class="anchor" href="#why-not-use-x-to-specify-aspect-models"></a>A.1. Why not use X to specify Aspect Models?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An extensive evaluation based on preliminary use cases was conducted to classify existing formats
and languages for the formulation of Aspect Models. This section summarizes the criteria and
candidates.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="general-assumptions"><a class="anchor" href="#general-assumptions"></a>A.1.1. General Assumptions</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally, the goal of Aspect Models is describing <em>information models</em> (as opposed to <em>data
models</em>). This means that the Meta Model used to describe Aspect Models should allow the
specification of context beyond mere data. For example, a data model would specify for a
<code>temperature</code> property the data type <code>float</code>, while an information model would also specify
information about the fact that the value was measured from a sensor, that the value has a certain
range (that corresponds to the value range given in the data sheet of the respective sensor), that
the value is given in degrees Celsius and a human-readable documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beyond this, the following use cases should specifically be supported:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Code generation for Aspect Implementations and Solution Client implementations. As multiple
programming languages and environments are going to be supported (e.g., Java, .NET Core, JavaScript),
the model format should be implementation language agnostic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Validation of data. Constraints, such as which properties in which classes and which data ranges
on which properties need to be validated against data at runtime. The necessary validation code (or
comparable constructs) should be able to use the model or be directly generated from the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable interchange between different tooling for the description of domain-specific modeling
tools. The format needs to be flexible and generic enough to allow model mapping or model
transformation to other formalisms. Being based on an open standard or de-facto standard and
consequently being supported by existing/third-party tools is a plus.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="why-not-json-schema-or-entity-relationship-modeling"><a class="anchor" href="#why-not-json-schema-or-entity-relationship-modeling"></a>A.1.2. Why not JSON Schema or Entity-Relationship-Modeling?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of describing <em>information models</em> rules out modeling approaches that are only applicable
to the data itself. Examples of such models are JSON Schema (and similar techniques such as XML
schema) and Entity-Relationship-Models. While existing tool support for data validation is good, the
thorough description of domain semantics is not the focus of such approaches and therefore ranges
between being inconvenient to outright impossible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="why-not-eclipse-vortos-dsl"><a class="anchor" href="#why-not-eclipse-vortos-dsl"></a>A.1.3. Why not Eclipse Vorto&#8217;s DSL?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/vorto/">Eclipse Vorto</a> provides a DSL (Domain Specific Language) with a
custom syntax for the specification of device interfaces. The expressive power of the language is
intentionally limited to the domain concepts of IoT device interfaces. Vorto provides model
validation and code generators that take models as an input. However, there is a strong conceptual
mismatch between the intended use of Vorto&#8217;s DSL and the goals of Aspect Models that can not easily
be dispelled due to intrinsic meta-model structure and semantics. For example, Vorto Models have no
concept comparable to Characteristics, don&#8217;t allow the specification of Entity or Characteristics
instances and use a different terminology than Aspect Models with no option to change or customize.
Furthermore, due to the fact that the DSL is specific to Vorto, there are no other tools or
libraries that support working with the models.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="why-not-owl"><a class="anchor" href="#why-not-owl"></a>A.1.4. Why not OWL?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Web Ontology Language (OWL, <a href="#owl2">[owl2]</a>) is the de-facto standard language for the description of
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology%20(information_science)">Ontologies</a></em>, i.e., the formal
description of things, sets of things and relations between things. &#8220;OWL is a computational
logic-based language such that knowledge expressed in OWL can be reasoned with by computer programs
either to verify the consistency of that knowledge or to make implicit knowledge explicit.&#8221; <a href="#owl2">[owl2]</a>
When speaking of semantic modeling, OWL is often the first choice of modeling language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In OWL, both the verification of consistency and inference of knowledge are based on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption">open-world assumption</a>, which means that what is
not known to be true or false is unknown. For example, having a class <code>Person</code> that requires a
property <code>name</code> and an instance of <code>Person</code> that has no <code>name</code> specified is no inconsistency&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it
just means that its <code>name</code> is currently unknown. This makes OWL well-suited to describe parts of a
domain that are later combined with other descriptions of parts of the same domain to end up with a
consistent and preferably complete overall description. Verification and inference are based on data
that is structured in a directed graph.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the main features of OWL&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;ascertaining consistency in a potentially incompletely modeled
world and the inference of knowledge&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;are both not goals of Aspect Models. On the other hand,
while some of the (mainly structural) constraints of an Aspect Model could be represented in OWL,
other parts focused on the validation of runtime data can not be represented. For example, a fact
like &#8220;there needs to be a certain tool in a certain machine&#8221; could easily be modeled in OWL, while
facts like &#8220;this Property describes an ordered set of data of a given structure&#8221; are
disproportionately complex to model in comparison to what OWL provides that an Aspect Model can make
use of. Additionally, closed-world semantics (the opposite of the open-world assumption) are
required for Aspect Models, as they are used to model data where, for example, a missing mandatory
property should directly result in a validation error.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Standard tools such as reasoners could therefore not be used unchanged to validate Aspect Models
described in OWL. Many conceptual constraints on what Aspect Models should be able to express are
based on the assumption that runtime data that corresponds to an Aspect is structured in a tree
(e.g., given in JSON). While possible to express in OWL, this would place the responsibility to get
this right on the model creator, who would need to be intimately familiar with the discipline of
Ontology Engineering, because standard OWL semantics allow more degrees of freedom. Figuratively
speaking, OWL is an all-terrain vehicle while we try to build a rail network. To a certain degree,
we want to exchange flexibility with ease of use in the target domain, increase modeling speed and
reduce the number of potential modeling errors by reducing the degrees of freedom.</p>

<h3 id="why-not-use-x-to-specify-the-aspect-meta-model-itself"><a class="anchor" href="#why-not-use-x-to-specify-the-aspect-meta-model-itself"></a>A.2. Why not use X to specify the Aspect Meta Model itself?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After deciding that a custom meta model and a suitable way to specify it is required for the
description of Aspect Models, an evaluation of how to specify the meta model itself was conducted.
As Aspect Models are specified in RDF, a straightforward and extensible way based on open standards
was adopted for the implementation of the Aspect Meta Model. The Aspect Meta Model is defined as a
combination of RDF vocabularies and a number of &#8220;shapes&#8221; defined SHACL <a href="#shacl">[shacl]</a>, a language for
validating RDF graphs against a set of conditions which in turn is based on SPARQL <a href="#sparql">[sparql]</a>, the
RDF query language. This combination of technologies is a natural fit for the description of
BAMM Aspect Meta Model&#8217;s closed world semantics.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>OWL could not have been used for this for reasons similar to its unfitness for the description of
Aspect Models, i.e., in addition to OWL&#8217;s intrinsic semantics, many validations would have to be
implemented manually in addition to standard reasoning, thus diminishing OWL&#8217;s overall value. This
said, it would be possible to express parts of BAMM Aspect Meta Model&#8217;s semantics in OWL if
necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Meta Model could have been implemented in a combination of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">UML</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Constraint_Language">OCL</a>. However, on the one hand, this
approach would have required increased complexity due to the use of an UML-to-RDF-mapping and on
the other hand, there exists not as much documentation and tool support for the respective
technologies.</p>

<h3 id="why-not-use-well-known-rdf-vocabularies-or-namespaces"><a class="anchor" href="#why-not-use-well-known-rdf-vocabularies-or-namespaces"></a>A.3. Why not use well-known RDF vocabularies or namespaces?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For model authors that have worked with RDF before, the use of the <code>bamm:</code> namespace as opposed to
using well-known vocabularies such as RDFS or
<a href="http://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core</a> is noticeable. With
the exception of the XSD namespace for datatypes, BAMM and Aspect Models define their
vocabulary in namespaces specific to BAMM. There are two reasons for this:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>BAMM namespaces use URNs instead of URLs as element identifiers. This is to avoid
confusion about resolvability: Working with Aspect Models (e.g., validating them or generating code
from them) must work in a stand-alone (i.e., offline) fashion. Avoiding using URLs that are not
supposed to be resolved avoids confusion among developers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BAMM namespaces are all versioned: Each version&#8217;s semantics are self-contained.
Should semantics of one version change, elements of previous versions can still be processed as
before. This is not possible when relying on externally defined, non-versioned namespaces.</p>
