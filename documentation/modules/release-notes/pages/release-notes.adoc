[[samm-2.1.0]]
== Release 2.1.0

{meta-model-abbr} 2.1.0 is the first feature release on the Eclipse Semantic Modeling Framework with improvements
on validation and documentation as follows:

[[samm-2.1.0-validation]]
=== Validation

* The validation rule "all Properties defined in an Entity as well as in the Entity or
  AbstractEntity it is extending must have a unique name" has been removed. This means that it is
  now valid that multiple Entities inheriting from a common parent may share names.
https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-semantic-aspect-meta-model/issues/161[Issue on Github].

* Validation of
  xref:ROOT:characteristics#time-series-characteristic[samm-c:TimeSeries] was
  improved: The referenced type is checked by the validation now.
  https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-sdk/issues/194[Issue on Github].

[[samm-2.1.0-documentation]]
=== Documentation

* The {meta-model-abbr} project now uses https://adr.github.io/madr/[MADR] as a template for
  https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record[Architecture Decision Records
  (ADR)]. https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-semantic-aspect-meta-model/pull/241[Issue on Github].

* Architecture decision records were added to properly document important past design decisions.

* Section on xref:ROOT:modeling-guidelines.adoc#declaring-events[Declaring
  Events] was added; wrong edges in the xref:ROOT:meta-model-elements.adoc[Meta
  Model Elements overview diagram] were fixed.
  https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-semantic-aspect-meta-model/issues/104[Issue on Github].

* xref:ROOT:modeling-guidelines.adoc#naming-rules[Naming convention] for Events
  was clarified: Events should use UpperCamelCase, like Aspects, Entities, Constraints and
  Characteristics. https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-semantic-aspect-meta-model/issues/147[Issue on Github].

* Section on xref:appendix:model-evolution.adoc[Model Evolution] was added in
  appendix. https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-semantic-aspect-meta-model/issues/82[Issue on
  Github].

* Reference to outdated terminology "leaf Characteristic" was fixed.
  https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-semantic-aspect-meta-model/pull/215[Issue on Github].

* Japanese sample text in xref:ROOT:datatypes.adoc[Data Types] was fixed.

[[samm-2.1.0-others]]
=== Others

* The {meta-model-abbr} project was set up to be based on shared
  https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-parent[esmf-parent] Maven parent project.
  https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-semantic-aspect-meta-model/issues/219[Issue on Github].

[[samm-2.0.0]]
== Release 2.0.0

This is the first release in the ESMF. Its structure and content is similar to that of the
<<bamm-2.0.0,Legacy BAMM Aspect Meta Model 2.0.0>>, which is why the version number 2.0.0 is kept.
This release changes RDF namespaces and prefix names according to the move from the Open
Manufacturing Platform (OMP) Semantic Data Structuring (SDS) working group BAMM Aspect Meta Model
(BAMM) to the Eclipse Semantic Modeling Framework (ESMF) Semantic Aspect Meta Model (SAMM).

* Meta model URNs are changed from `urn:bamm:io.openmanufacturing:<element-type>:<version>#<element-name>` to `urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:<element-type>:<version>#<element-name>`.
* The namespace rules for model elements changed accordingly from `bamm` to `samm` in the URN schema.
* RDF prefixes are renamed from `bamm`, `bamm-c` and `bamm-e` to `samm`, `samm-c` and `samm-e`, respectively.

NOTE: Version 1.0.0 of the meta model was released in the scope of the Open Manufacturing Platform (OMP)
and was called _BAMM Aspect Meta Model (BAMM)_. Version 2.0.0 was also released as _BAMM_, then
re-released as Eclipse Semantic Modeling Framework (ESMF) Semantic Aspect Meta Model (SAMM) 2.0.0.

[[bamm-2.0.0]]
== Release 2.0.0 (Legacy: BAMM)

* Introduce Entity inheritance, the according Meta Model Element `bamm:AbstractEntity` and
  `bamm:AbstractProperty` as well as the `bamm:extends` attribute to define a hierarchy of Entities.
  This replaces the concept of refining an entity and the `bamm:refines` attribute in order to
  reduce complexity and modeling efforts.
* Remove the `bamm:name` attribute to remove redundancy. The "short" name
  of an element is the local name part of its URI, i.e., the part following the `#` symbol.
* The meta model elements `Unit`, `QuantityKinds` and their corresponding attributes have been moved
  from the `unit` namespace to the `bamm` namespace. The unit namespace is now solely reserved for
  the units of the xref:appendix:unitcatalog.adoc#unit-catalog-units[unit
  catalog] itself.
* The
   https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-semantic-aspect-meta-model/blob/main/src/main/resources/samm/unit/2.0.0/units.ttl[formal
   description (units.ttl)] of the units catalog is now automatically generated from its original
   source (see xref:ROOT:units.adoc[Units]) and the
   https://github.com/eclipse-esmf/esmf-semantic-aspect-meta-model/blob/main/esmf-samm-build-plugin/src/main/resources/custom-units.ttl[local adjustments].
* The `localeCode` and `languageCode` attributes have been moved from the `bamm` namespace to the
  `bamm-c` namespace.
* Shared model elements have been adjusted:
** The xref:ROOT:entities.adoc#point-3d[Point3d Entity] has been changed to use
   Abstract Properties for its components;
** The xref:ROOT:entities.adoc#time-series-entity[Time Series Entity] has been
   changed to use an Abstract Property for its `value` component
* The attributes `bamm:properties`, `bamm:operations` and `bamm:events` on `bamm:Aspect` are now
  optional, i.e., they do not have to be added any more even when they are empty lists.
* Various issues in the specification (including examples) have been fixed and phrasing has been improved.

[[bamm-1.0.0]]
== Release 1.0.0

This is the initial release for the Open Manufacturing Platform.
